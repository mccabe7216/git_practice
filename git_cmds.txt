git status //shows changes to be committed, not staged for commit, and untracked
git add filename //moves file from working directory to staging area
	git add * //wildcard
	git add . //adds all files
git diff filename //shows difference between file in working directory and staging area
git commit filename -m "message" //moves file from staging area to repository
git commit -m "message" //moves all files from staging area to repository
	git commit scene* //asterix is a wildcard and will pull scene-3.txt and scene-7.txt
git log //shows history of commits
git show HEAD //shows most recent commit
	HEAD commit is the commit you are currently on
git checkout HEAD filename //Discards changes in the working directory. Replaces with HEAD version.
git reset HEAD filename //Unstages file changes in the staging area. Changes remain in working directory.
git reset 5d69206 //This command works by using the first 7 characters of the SHA of a previous commit. HEAD is now set to that previous commit. Your staging area is also updated to that previous commit. Your working directory, however, does not change



git branch //lists the branches; asterix by the one you are on
git branch new_branch_name //create new branch
git checkout branch_name //switch to branch of choice
git merge giver_branch_name //checkout the receiver branch then run this command to merge the givver branch into the receiever branch
	"fast-forward": git recognizes that the giver branch contains the most recent commit
	"merge conflict": when edits conflict and auto-merging cannot occur; must go into file and resolve merge conflict manually. then add/commit the change.
git branch -d branch_name //delete branch

git remote add origin https://github.com/mccabe7216/test1.git
git push -u origin master

git clone remote_location clone_name //create your own replica of a remote repository
	"remote_location": tells Git where to go to find the remote. This could be a web address, or a filepath
	"clone_name": the name you give to the directory in which Git will clone the repository.
	When you run this cmd, git gives the remote address the name origin, so that you can refer easily
git remote -v //lists git project remotes
git fetch //This command will not merge changes from the remote into your local repository. It brings those changes onto what’s called a remote branch. Learn more about how this works below.
git push origin giver_branch //pushes your branch to the remote where it can be reviewed and merged
